# Overview

This README provides an overview of how to use the SilKit demo applications for communication across CAN, Ethernet, and Gateway protocols. The demo applications include:

- **Registry**
- **EthernetWriter**
- **CanReader**
- **Gateway**

Each of these components can be run using a `.yaml` configuration file, and they support asynchronous operation with the `--async` flag.

# Application Architecture

## 1. Registry

### Description:
The `SilKit Registry` is a central registry for managing and registering different SilKit components. It is used to coordinate communication between various applications.

### Command to run:
```bash
./GatewayApplication2/executables/sil-kit-registry
```

Make sure that the registry is running before starting other components.

---

## 2. EthernetWriter

### Description:
The `EthernetWriter` demo application simulates an Ethernet bus writer. It reads from a `.yaml` configuration file and transmits Ethernet messages to the bus.

### Command to run:
```bash
./GatewayApplication2/executables/EthernetWriter GatewayApplication/Demo.silkit.yaml --async
```

This command runs the `EthernetWriter` in asynchronous mode, where it will continuously send Ethernet messages based on the configuration specified in `Demo.silkit.yaml`.

---

## 3. CanReader

### Description:
The `CanReader` demo application simulates reading data Sent from the Gateway application. It processes incoming messages based on the provided `.yaml` configuration.

### Command to run:
```bash
./GatewayApplication2/executables/CanReader GatewayApplication/Demo.silkit.yaml --async
```

This command runs the `CanReader` in asynchronous mode, continuously reading Can messages coming from the Gateway application according to the configuration specified in `Demo.silkit.yaml`.

---

## 4. Gateway

### Description:
The `Gateway` application bridges communication between CAN and Ethernet networks. It allows for seamless data transfer between these two protocols.

### Command to run:
```bash
./GatewayApplication2/executables/Gateway GatewayApplication/Demo.silkit.yaml --async
```

This command runs the `Gateway` in asynchronous mode, facilitating communication between EthernetWriter and CanReader, based on the configuration specified in `Demo.silkit.yaml`.

---

## Configuration File (`Demo.silkit.yaml`)

The `.yaml` configuration file should specify the parameters for each application, including network settings, transport layers, and other required configurations. It must be structured in a format that is compatible with SilKit.

---

## Running the Demo Applications

1. **Start the Registry**: First, ensure the registry is running by executing the command for the `SilKit Registry`.
2. **Start the EthernetWriter**: After the registry is up and running, execute the `EthernetWriter` command to send messages via Ethernet.
3. **Start the CanReader**: Run the `CanReader` to start receiving Can messages.
4. **Start the Gateway**: Finally, launch the `Gateway` application to enable communication between CAN and Ethernet networks.

---

## Notes

- Ensure that your environment is properly configured for SilKit applications.
- All applications are run in asynchronous mode with the `--async` flag to allow for continuous operations.
- The `Demo.silkit.yaml` file must be adjusted to match your specific network configuration and settings.

This README provides the basic steps to get started with the SilKit demo applications. For more advanced usage or troubleshooting, refer to the SilKit documentation.
